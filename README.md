## The problem

Markdown is awesome, and so are Progressive Web Apps like
[Dillinger](dillinger.io) that allow you to write in Markdown and get the HTML
all from within the browser. But having to touch your mouse to navigate takes
your focus away from your writing and is a real hassle.

## This solution

Markdown + Progressive Web Application + Vim = Heaven. That's what this
application does. Clone this repo to run it locally, in the cloud or simply
create an online account at \_**\_coming soon\_\_** and use the hosted version
for free!

Features:

- Enable/disable Vim keyboard navigation
- Toggle between Markdown/HTML
- Export as Markdown, HTML, or styled PDF
- Create account to save your pages using encryption
- Responsive, mobile-friendly design
- Zen mode for distraction-free writing
- Day/Night themes
